# D597 Data Management
## Task 1: Relational Database Design and Implementation

### Introduction
A common undertaking for a data analyst is to create databases using existing datasets. This process involves the exploration of the source and target datasets to merge the data in a meaningful and logical way.


You will replicate this common process in this task. You will take external data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file and design a logical data model that describes the data. You will load the data into a databases solution and run queries across it.


Choose one of the scenarios provided in the Supporting Documents. Each scenario has associated CSV files that will be located on the desktop of the WGU Virtual Lab environment. You will complete the following:

1. Design a relational database solution.
2. Implement the solution.
3. Present the solution using Panopto to an audience that consists of your peers within a project team.
 

You will complete this performance assessment in the provided WGU Virtual Lab environment. Your submission will be a design document that includes screenshots of your work in the lab environment and a Panopto video.
