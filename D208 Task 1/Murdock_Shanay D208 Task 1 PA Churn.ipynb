    "Customer churn is a significant issue in the highly competitive telecommunications market, with some companies experiencing churn rates as high as 25% annually (per D208 Data Dictionary). To avoid customers leaving and signing up with competitors, there is much to be gained across the company by understanding what factors keep existing customers and improving tenure over time. This analysis can aid informed decision-making by understanding what factors to capitalize on and which need dedicated improvement."

    "This analysis aims to gain greater insight into what factors directly contribute to customer tenure. Multiple linear regression can be used to assess what factors in the dataset (independent variables) directly impact customer tenure (dependent variable). Identification of these factors can assist executives in being more responsive to what drives customers to stay with the company versus leaving the company for a competitor. This frees up resources needed to recruit as many new or previous customers as possible and works to gain more long-term customer loyalty. Linear regression allows us to make predictions based on certain conditions; early alerts for potential customer churn give the company time to pivot and address issues that could retain customers, whether from a customer service perspective or a quality of service perspective."

High correlations among predictor variables create data redundancies, and having more correlated data reduces the value it can provide. This assumption is shared with multiple logistic regression.\n",

One observation cannot be the reason another observation exists in the dataset, there cannot be any repeat measurements of the same identity, and observations cannot be related to each other in any way. This assumption is shared with multiple logistic regression.\n",

It is also highly structured, meaning that because of the assumptions stated in B1, there are constraints on what data can be used to retrieve accurate output data. This places guidelines on what types of data (and their subsequent relationships) can be used in the model.\n",
