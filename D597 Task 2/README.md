## Task 2: Non-relational Database Design and Implementation

### Introduction
A common undertaking for a data analyst is to create databases using existing datasets. This process involves the exploration of the source and target datasets to merge the data in a meaningful and logical way.


You will replicate this common process as you complete this task. You will take external data from either a document dataset or a graphical dataset and design a non-relational database solution. You will load the data into a database solution and retrieve or modify the data using JSON datasets and MongoDB in the virtual lab environment.



Choose one of the scenarios provided in the Supporting Documents. Each scenario has associated JSON files that will be located on the desktop of the WGU Virtual Lab environment. You will complete the following:

1. Design a non-relational database solution.

2. Implement the solution.

3. Present the solution using Panopto to an audience that consists of your peers within a project team.
 

Note: It is recommended to use the other scenario, different from the one you used in Task 1.
